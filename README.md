- 👋 Hi, I’m @pscobey
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, 
things I know something about already, as well as Go and Rust, about which I currently know nothing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git in order to teach my students how to use it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing till I'm a little more comfortable with Git.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
